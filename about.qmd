Hi and welcome to my personal website. Here I will be sharing my journey into Data Science. It all started with the Google Data Analytics course in April 2021. It was a fun ride and I recommend it to anyone entering this field. I am currently studying other areas of Data Science and I am super excited about it.

I â™¡ hiking, nature, reading, photography, traveling, math, and R!

I live in Zagreb, Croatia, with my two boys (life partner and our sweet son).

If you'd like to connect with me, please do.
